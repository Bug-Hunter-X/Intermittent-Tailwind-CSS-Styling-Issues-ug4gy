# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Styling Issues

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes do not consistently apply their styles, despite appearing correctly defined in the HTML.

## Description

The issue involves situations where Tailwind classes are applied to an element, but the resulting styles are not what's expected. The behaviour is inconsistent, appearing in certain components or contexts but not others.

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Observe that the button's hover effect and/or font styles may not be applied as expected.

## Solution

The solution involves investigating the potential sources of the conflict, such as CSS specificity, conflicting stylesheets, or improper class order.

The `solution.html` shows one way to resolve this issue by more precisely targeting styles or ensuring that no other CSS rules are overriding the Tailwind styles.
