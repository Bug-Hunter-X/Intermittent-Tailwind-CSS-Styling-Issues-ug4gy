The solution might involve several approaches:

1. **Check for conflicting styles:** Ensure no other CSS rules (either in your own stylesheets or from other libraries) are overriding the Tailwind classes. Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the element's computed styles and identify potential conflicts.
2. **Inspect class order:** The order of classes can matter in certain cases. Try rearranging the classes to see if that resolves the issue.
3. **Increase specificity:**  If necessary, add more specific CSS rules to override any conflicting styles. This might involve using more specific selectors or the `!important` flag (though use the latter judiciously).
4. **Purge unused styles:** Make sure Tailwind's purge mechanism is properly configured to remove unused styles, preventing conflicts.
5. **Verify Tailwind installation:** Double-check that Tailwind is correctly installed and configured.

Here's a possible solution (demonstrated in `solution.html`) which involves adding a more specific rule to ensure your desired styling is applied:
```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded relative">
  <span class="absolute inset-0">
  Button
  </span>
</div>
```
