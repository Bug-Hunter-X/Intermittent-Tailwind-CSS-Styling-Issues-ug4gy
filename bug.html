The following Tailwind CSS classes are not applied correctly, resulting in unexpected styling.  This occurs when using specific combinations of classes or within certain components or contexts.
```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Button
</div>
```
The background color might not transition to blue-700 on hover, or the font might not be bold, even though the classes seem correctly applied.
